# Stock-News
Stocks news is a project that is intended to get the news from a particulat stock, then it will calculate if the stock when up or down from yesterday, since I am using a free API the stock is not updated in real time. After making a call to the Stock API, I gather the data and got the closing price from the 2 days before as well as the closing price from the day before. This is disregarding the after market and pre-market. Calculationg are made if the is the stock when up or down. Then I make a call to the news API to get relevant news related to the particular stock. Then I get the 3 most relevant articles, to include in the text message. I am interedted in the title and well as the summary of the article. In teh SMS message that will be sent, included is the stock percentage if it went up or down and what percentage. As well as 3 articles related to the stock with the title and the summary of the article. As of now there are not known bugs.
